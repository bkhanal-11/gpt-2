# Generative Pre-Training 2 (GPT-2)

GPT-2 is a state-of-the-art language model developed by [OpenAI in 2019](https://d4mucfpksywv.cloudfront.net/better-language-models/language-models.pdf). It is a deep learning neural network model designed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as text completion, text generation, translation, and summarization. GPT-2 uses unsupervised learning, which means it was trained on vast amounts of text data without any specific task in mind.

The architecture of GPT-2 is based on the Transformer model's decoder. The Transformer model is known for its ability to handle long-range dependencies in sequential data, such as natural language. It uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of each word in a sequence, allowing the model to capture complex relationships between different parts of the text.

GPT-2 has 1.5 billion parameters, which makes it one of the largest language models available. It was trained on a diverse range of text data, including books, articles, and web pages, to capture a broad range of language patterns and styles. The training process involved predicting the next word in a sequence of text, based on the preceding words. This approach is known as language modeling, and it allows the model to learn the probabilities of different words and sequences of words.

GPT-2 has been used for a variety of NLP tasks, including language translation, question-answering, and text summarization. However, it is best known for its ability to generate realistic and coherent text, sometimes to the point of being indistinguishable from human-written text. This has raised concerns about the potential misuse of such technology, and OpenAI initially decided not to release the full model due to the risk of malicious use. However, they later released smaller versions of the model for research and development purposes.
